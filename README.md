# Snow Globe Shader Project

Welcome to the Snow Globe Shader Project! This project showcases a ray-marched 3D snow globe rendered using GLSL shaders, HTML, and JavaScript. The snow globe features a transparent glass sphere with realistic refraction and reflection, a base, and animated snow particles inside. The shader implements physics-based rendering techniques to achieve a realistic and visually engaging effect.

## Features
- Transparent Glass Sphere: Realistic refraction and reflection simulate the appearance of glass.
- Fresnel Effect: Adjusts reflectivity based on the viewing angle for added realism.
- Animated Snow Particles: Procedural noise creates dynamic snow inside the globe.
- Realistic Lighting: Incorporates ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting components.
- Dynamic Background: Background color changes over time, enhancing visual appeal.
- Interactive Camera: Use mouse or touch controls to adjust the camera view.

## Features

- Refraction and Reflection: The glass sphere realistically bends and reflects light, simulating how glass interacts with light in the real world.
- Animated Snow: Snow particles inside the globe move and flow, creating a lifelike snowfall effect.
- Realistic Lighting: Incorporates ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to give depth and dimension to the scene.
- Simple Controls: Camera position and zoom can be adjusted to view the snow globe from different angles.

## Installation
No special installation is required. Simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:ZilbaM/shader-snowglobe-js.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd shader-snowglobe-js

# Open index.html in your preferred web browser or open a live server
```

Alternatively, you can download the ZIP file of the repository, extract it, and open `index.html` in your browser.

## Usage

- Viewing the Snow Globe: Open index.html in a web browser to view the rendered snow globe.
- Interactive Controls:
    - Rotate Camera: Click and drag the mouse to rotate the camera around the snow globe.
    - Zoom In/Out: Use the mouse scroll wheel or touchpad gestures to zoom in and out.
- Experimentation:
    - Modify the shader parameters in the JavaScript or GLSL code to see how they affect the rendering.
    - Adjust lighting, material properties, or snow density to customize the scene.
