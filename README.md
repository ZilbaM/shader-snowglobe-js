# Snow Globe Shader Project
This project is a visual simulation of a snow globe using GLSL shaders. It showcases a glass sphere containing animated snow particles, all rendered with realistic lighting and material effects.

## Overview

- Glass Sphere: Represents the snow globe's transparent enclosure, allowing you to see the snow and base inside.
- Snow Particles: Animated snowflakes that move inside the globe, creating a dynamic and engaging effect.
- Base: The support structure of the snow globe, adding realism to the scene.
- Dynamic Background: A background that changes color over time, enhancing the overall visual appeal.

## Features

- Refraction and Reflection: The glass sphere realistically bends and reflects light, simulating how glass interacts with light in the real world.
- Animated Snow: Snow particles inside the globe move and flow, creating a lifelike snowfall effect.
- Realistic Lighting: Incorporates ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting to give depth and dimension to the scene.
- Simple Controls: Camera position and zoom can be adjusted to view the snow globe from different angles.
